## 2. Background 
 
## Topic Overview:
The project I have chosen is the Telecom Customer Churn Prediction. In the telecom companies, reliability of the customers plays a vital role in-order to maintain revenue to the companies which is the ultimate benefit for every organization. The interest and main goal of the project is to predict the churn rate of the customer for the telecom company. The Churn rate is that the rate at which the customers discontinue the telecom service. By developing a ML predictive model, it will identify the customer's churn rate based on the previous historial data and so that the company will implement the strategies in-order to minimize the churn.

## Importance in choosing the topic:
The Churn issue is very important for any company especially for telecom companies mainly in-terms of the business perspective. Few of the reasons that will impact the organization during Churn are:
The reduction in the revenue costs, it will become expensive for the companies to invest in acquiring the new customers and to maintain stability in the no. of customers using the telecom service.
Ensuring trust is the most crucial aspect and the trust-worthy business will stay consistent in the long-run with profits. 
In a broader aspect, ultimately the Churn effects the job stability within the organization and could minimize the profits of the organization.
By considering all these factors, I believe it is very important and it matters to minimize the Churn rate in the Telecom companies.

## Research questions:
1. Can we identify these Churn early using by any measures ?
2. How accurate we can predict the churn rate using the machine learning prediction models ?
3. After all the measures, how much percentage we can constantly maintain the revenue of the telecom companies ?

- Size of the dataset is - 1.40 MB
- Our dataset has 38 columns and 7,043 customer data in total. 
- Each row represent the customer data according to the specific column.
- Attaching the image of the columns that are present in the dataset.

## Which variable/column will be your target/label in your ML model?
The model that will be targeted in the model is the 'Customer Status' column
## Which variables/columns may be selected as features/predictors for your ML models?
All the columns excluding the 'Customer Status' column can be selected for the features/predictors.
